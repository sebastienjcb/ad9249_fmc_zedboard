# ad9249_fmc_zedboard

This exemple explain how to connect the analog to digital converter AD9249 to the ZedBoard.
First i'll work on the vivado suite form xilinx to build an efficient base to develop our hardware. 
Second i'll develop the code for execute efficently the stream of the data from the AD9249 to the zedboard. 
And finally i'll work on an embedded system bases on the use on local memory to instance our project.
